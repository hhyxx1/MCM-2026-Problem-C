Data Pre-processing
Since we can only use the official COMAP dataset ’Problem_C_Data_Wordle.xlsx’,
and the given data is obtained by mining Twitter, there is a possibility of data anoma-
lies, so we pre-processed this part of the data before building the model.
• Fill: We replace the outliers in Number of reported results with the average of the
before and after data.
• Reject: We remove the entire data where the sum of the distribution of the re-
ported results deviates from 100%.
• We remove the entire word that has a number of letters not equal to 5, including
"clen" and "tash".

Data Cleaning
Observing the provided data, some problems and corresponding processing are found as follows.
Referencing the Wordle Status and we discovered that there were some erroneous data in the
attachment. These included incorrect word lengths, spelling errors, and incorrect values in Number
of reported results, among others. For instance, the word at 314 was mistakenly written as "tash".
Additionally, the Number of reported results at 529 was erroneously recorded as 2569. To address
these issues, we conducted data cleaning to minimize errors , and to enhance the quality and
accuracy of our data . The following are the results of our data cleaning process.

During our data inspection, we identified instances where the sum of the proportion of attempts
for certain days did not equal 100% due to statistical errors. To address this issue, we recalculated
the proportions for each day so that the sum would be exactly 100%. By doing so, we aimed to
reduce errors associated with the same
P variable on different days and to improve the accuracy of
our model.Our processing result is ...

Data Cleaning
While examining the dataset we found two types of outliers in the dataset: word lengths
that are not 5 and an unusually low number of total reports. Details of the anomalous data
are as follows.

To ensure the correctness of the data, we chose to use the removal of anomalous data
instead of correction and interpolation.
For KNN regression and classification, to avoid the effect of magnitudes on calculat-
ing the distance between observations, we normalized the data according to the following
equation.
𝑥𝑖𝑗∗ =
𝑥𝑖𝑗 − 𝑥
𝑠𝑑 (𝑋𝑗 )
,
where 𝑥𝑖𝑗 is i-th observation of criteria j, 𝑋𝑗 is all the observations of criteria j, 𝑥𝑖𝑗∗ is
normalized data. The normalized data had a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.

Data pre-processing
Before building the model, a preliminary check of the data in the report is needed. Ac-
cording to the rules of Wordle, each word is 5 letters long. But there are unusual statistics of 4
or 6 letters in the data. Errors in words can interfere with the analysis of word attributes later,
so the word data were corrected based on past answer data1. Based on the relationship between
the number of reports, we found that there was a large deviation between the number of results
of No. 529 and the values on the before and after dates. Therefore, we considered it as abnormal
data and corrected it by taking the average value of the data for each of the two days before
and after. The overall pre-processing process is shown in Figure 2.

In the data shown above, the two words numbered 525, and 314 do not match the game because they
are only 4 in length, so we inferred that the dataset blundered by under-entering the letters. To solve
such a problem, we found the most similar letters to them instead by comparing them with artificial
intelligence algorithms. The word numbered 540 is due to a misspelling of the letter, which should
be ”naive.” We searched the word database and found that the word ”marxh,” numbered 473, did not
exist. We then compared the shapes of the words with database analysis and concluded that the correct
spelling should be ”marsh.” The word numbered 207 has an extra space in the input, so it is also an
outlier. We can delete the extra space to get the correct data.

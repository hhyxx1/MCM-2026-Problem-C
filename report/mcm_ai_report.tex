\section*{Declaration}

This paper utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) for assistance during the research and writing process. We disclose the following uses in compliance with MCM/ICM requirements.

\section*{Specific Uses of AI Tools}

\subsection*{1. Ideation and Framework Design}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Tool Used:} Claude (Anthropic)
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Brainstorming the Pareto optimization framework for balancing fairness and engagement objectives
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} AI suggested the dual-objective formulation; team refined metrics (JFI, FFI) based on domain knowledge
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Coding Support}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Tool Used:} GitHub Copilot / Claude
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Generating Python code snippets for MCMC sampling (Metropolis-Hastings algorithm)
        \item Monte Carlo simulation for parallel universe analysis
        \item Data preprocessing pipelines (age splines, one-hot encoding)
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} AI-generated code was reviewed, tested, and debugged by team members; all final implementations verified against expected outputs
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Writing and Refinement}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Tool Used:} Claude
    \item \textbf{Purpose:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checking for logical gaps in the methodology (e.g., adding Coefficient of Variation and Posterior Consistency metrics)
        \item LaTeX formatting assistance
        \item Grammar and clarity improvements
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} All substantive content decisions made by human team members
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Literature and Concept Clarification}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{Tool Used:} ChatGPT
    \item \textbf{Purpose:} Explaining Bayesian inference concepts and Kendall's tau interpretation
    \item \textbf{Outcome:} Used for learning; all citations verified through original sources
\end{itemize}

\section*{Human Verification and Responsibility}

We confirm that:

\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
    \item \textbf{All mathematical derivations} were verified by hand or through independent computation
    \item \textbf{All code execution} was performed on our own machines with results manually inspected
    \item \textbf{All statistical results} (accuracy rates, correlation coefficients, etc.) were computed from actual data, not AI-generated
    \item \textbf{All final conclusions and recommendations} represent the judgment of human team members
    \item \textbf{No AI-generated text} was used verbatim without review and modification
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Tools and Versions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Claude (Anthropic, January 2026)
    \item ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-4, January 2026)
    \item GitHub Copilot (VS Code extension)
    \item Python 3.11 with NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib
\end{itemize}
